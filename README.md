# Diego's Obstacle World

## How to Run
This program cannot be run on any IDE. It has to be run on the web editor [open processing](openprocessing.org/). This repository simply serves as a reference to copy and paste the source code to this web editor.

## Project Description
The user is creating a storm of color and orbs that interact with its environment. Using a bit of my previous knowledge in computational geometry, I make the orbs bounce off the walls and the barriers of the frame. The user is engaged by their influence in the initial effects of the populating process. After that, the interaction between the orbs is more of a spectacle for the user to enjoy and take a still image using the UP key. To help them make something they are proud to share, I've made it so that each orb leaves a trail of its previous sixty positions. This way, the image isn't just a couple of orbs bouncing around the page, but a replication of the natural physics behind bouncing orbs.

## Bugs
The only known bugs consist of the freezing functionality. When freezing, the orbs themselves stay still their trials continue to disappear until there are just orbs on the screen. The images in the sample folder are screenshots I took while the orbs were still moving. 

## Significance to Me
This project was an opportunity to enjoy my interest in computational geometry. Although the class itself was difficult, the projects I completed for that class made me a more independent programmer and thinking about how image rendering would be affected by the way I write my code. Though it can be argued whether the user will enjoy the experience or not, I surely enjoyed the process of making this project. 

## Challenges
This project was especially challenging to me because of the thinking that goes behind maintaining an unlimited number of objects. Storing objects while working and manipulating the attributes of each one in addition to simplifying all this while keeping a crisp frame count is key for making this program run smoothly.
