# Diego's Obastacle World

## Project Description
The user is creating a storm of color and orbs that interact with its environement. Using a bit of my previous knowledge in computational geometry, I manages to make the orbs bounce off the walls and the barriers of the frame. The user is engaged by the their influence in the intial effects of the populating process. After that, the interaction between the orbs are more of a spectacle for the user to enjoy and take a still image using the UP key. To help them make something they are proud to share, I've made so that each orb leaves a trail of its previous sixty positions. This way, the image isn't just a couple of orbs bouncing around the page, but a replication of the natural physics behind bouncing orbs.

## Bugs
The only known bugs consist of the freezing functionality. When frezzing, the orbs themselves stay still by their trials contibue to disappear until there are just orbs on the screen. The images im the sample folder are screenshots I've taken while the orbs were still moving. 

## Significance to Me
This project, to me, was an opportunity to enjoy my interest in computational geometry. Although the class itself was difficult, the projects I completed for that class made me a more independent programmer and thinking about how image rendering would be affected by way I write my code. Though it can be argued whether the user will enjoy the experience or not, I surely enojoyed the process of making this project. 

## Challenges
This project was especially challenging to me because of the thinking that goes behind maintianting an unlimited number of objects. Storing objects while working and manipulating with the attributes of each one in addition to simplifying all this while keeping a crisp frame count is key for making this program run smoothly.
